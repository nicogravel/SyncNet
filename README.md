# SyncNet


Phase synchronization network model in Matlab based on the theory of weakly coupled oscillators. This approach assumes that nodes in a network are active, self-sustained oscillators, whose behaviour can be approximated by knowing their phase relations (Kuramoto, 1995; Hansel, 1995). Initial conditions are all set to random. Current example is in Matlab. A random connectivity matrix is fed into the model to reproduce the empirical dynamics of phase relations.

### Background

* Local phase clustering --> segregation, Global phase clustering --> integration.
* Self-organized criticality in the dynamical working point of the brain enables optimal information encoding and computations.
* Variability in spatiotemporal order as a fingerprint of metastability. Systems at the cusp of instability (Deco et al., 2027).


### Shortcomings

* Difficulties in defining empirical structural connectivity
* Physiological variability.
* Measurement uncertainty.
